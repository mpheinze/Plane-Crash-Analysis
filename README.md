# Plane-Crash-Analysis
A web-scraper of global plane crashes and analysis of the likelihood of two plane crashes happening right after each other.

This study set out to investigate the hypothesis that it's generally safer to fly with a passenger airline in the immediate aftermath of a large plane crash. This is because the whole airline industry is more alert in the days/weeks after a big crash and thus less prone to human errors being made thus resulting is a lower chance of another fatal incident happening right away.
